# FreshLanDiv
This repository contains data and code necessary to reproduce figures in the data paper “FreshLanDiv: A global database of freshwater biodiversity across different land uses”. In this database, we compiled a global database encompassing 241 studies with species abundance data (from multiple biological groups and geographic locations) across sites with different land-use categories. The database includes metadata of each study, sites location, sample methods, sample time, land-use category, and abundance of each taxon.
